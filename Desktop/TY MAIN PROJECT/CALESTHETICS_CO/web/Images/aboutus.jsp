        <h2 style="font-family:'Noticia Text', serif monospace; color:black;font-weight: 600;font-size:300">Bodyweight training comes in two forms: with and without equipment.

Pure bodyweight training would be a situation you could find yourself in when at home, or not able to access any kind of apparatus: there is nothing for you to hang off of or push against, it is purely how you can use your body weight in an empty room or everyday items such as chairs or tables.<br>

On the other hand bodyweight training could mean using your bodyweight to train, either in the gym or with access to a pull-up frame, with the specific intention of working on your strength-to-bodyweight ratio.

With this in mind, I’m going to give you two different templates that you can follow, because there is a big difference in terms of goals you can achieve with each type of training.<br>

This post will focus on pure bodyweight training, or a template with which to train if you are at home and don’t have any equipment or anything to even hang off of.<br>

Check back soon for another Template which will give you a rundown of exercises and a routine for those who want to develop their ability to handle their bodyweight (i.e. for a sport like climbing).</h2>

Most of you will have heard of the plank, where you support yourself on your elbows and toes whilst trying to keep your body straight.

It is an effective exercise, but only if you can’t do many push-ups; if you can hold the push-up position then you can essentially save time and do two things at once.<br>

Doing 30 non-stop push-ups can take around a minute, a minute where you have been holding a more difficult position of the plank (arms extended is more tiring).<br>

If you can’t do anymore push-ups, then hold the top position or drop to the plank (on your elbows) and hold as long as you can.</h2>

        <h2 style="font-family:'Noticia Text', serif monospace; color:black;font-weight: 600;font-size:300">Upper body
Push-ups- No need for an introduction, push-ups are still one of the best movements and tests of strength and endurance.<br>

It is important however that you do them properly.  Everyone has seen the videos of ‘150 consecutive push-ups’ where the person is barely bending their arms whilst arching their back.

I’ll have a dedicated article coming soon about push-ups: in the meantime the key things to remember are

Back is straight, abdominals tense.  This is sometimes hard to tell yourself so get someone to look at you from the side and make sure that your body is in a straight line.
Hands not too much wider than shoulder width, with the elbows around 45 degrees to your body (i.e. the elbows are not too flared).  This might make it a bit harder, but it saves a lot of stress on your shoulders.
Remember the push-up is used to strengthen your chest, your shoulders, your triceps (back of the upper arm) and your core (lower back and abdominals).<br>

So you should really be aiming to stay tight and concentrate on the contraction of your chest and triceps.<br>

Don’t just smash the reps out.<br>

Handstand push-ups.  If you can do a few reps of these you’re doing better than most: this is the equivalent to pushing your bodyweight overhead using only your arms and shoulders.  <br>

Once you are comfortable doing a few sets of 30 rep inclined push-ups you can give these a go, although make sure you do these first in your session as you want to be fresh. <br>

Use a wall to balance against so you can concentrate on pressing.<br>

Take it further: there’s not a pure bodyweight exercise that will test your pressing strength more than a handstand push-up, but if you really want to demonstrate body control, strength and balance try handstand walks. 

Get up on your hands and try to move forward.  Simple, eh?<br>

Lower body
Bodyweight squat- As with push-ups, pretty well-known but not always correctly executed exercise.<br>

Although the squat is a natural human movement, the flexibility and strength to perform a full, controlled squat is something that is lost to many people as they grow up, due in part to the modern sedentary lifestyle.

The key to performing it well is down to having adequate posterior chain flexibility. <br> Put simply, you want to be able to descend so your thighs are at least parallel to the ground whilst maintaining a flat tense lower back and without your knees going too far over your toes.

If you can go lower than parallel then try it, as long as you can maintain a flat back.<br>

Again, don’t just pump the reps out, bouncing at the bottom.  Do each rep with a one second down one second up rhythm, making sure you maintain your form.

Aim to do as many reps as you can without your form breaking down.  Recover for 2 minutes and repeat.<br>

I emphasise again that this is not going to make you massively strong, but it will do a good job of activating the muscles in your posterior chain whilst increasing muscular endurance.

Make it harder:<br>

Too easy?  Try one-legged squats, also known as pistols.<br>

Same principle, but now you’re supporting your bodyweight with only one leg.  This is also very much a balance movement, and one that will take practice and coordination to achieve.
